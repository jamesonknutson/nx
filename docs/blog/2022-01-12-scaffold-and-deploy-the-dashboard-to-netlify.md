This is the second article in a series of articles that aims to showcase the process of scaffolding and deploying a Micro Frontend Architecture using [Nx](https://nx.dev/) and [Netlify](https://netlify.com/). We will generate the Dashboard application as a host app and walk through the steps of deploying it to Netlify.
