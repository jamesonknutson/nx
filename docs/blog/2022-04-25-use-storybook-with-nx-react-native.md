### How to add Storybook to Nx React Native applications

In my previous [blogs](https://emilyxiong.medium.com/share-code-between-react-web-react-native-mobile-with-nx-fe5e22b5a755) _(see links at the end)_, I wrote about how to develop Nx React Native applications. However, as developers, we are constantly searching for ways to make the developer experience better.

yarn add --dev @nrwl/storybook
```

Then you need to generate the storybook configuration for your app or lib:
